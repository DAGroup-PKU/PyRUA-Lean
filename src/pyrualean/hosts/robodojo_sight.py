"""An object's 3D extent from its masks in colour cameras alone: no depth image.

RoboDojo's evaluation client, as configured, hands a policy three colour images and the
robot's state: depth and camera matrices are switched off in its config.  The cameras' poses
are nevertheless known.  The head
camera never moves, and each wrist camera is bolted to its arm's end-effector link, whose pose
is part of the state (:func:`head_view`, :func:`wrist_view`; the numbers were read off the
simulator once).  So every pixel is a known ray, and an object that stands on a known plane
(the table) can be measured from where the rays of its mask go:

*   A mask in ONE camera says where the object's shadow falls on the table as seen from that
    camera: the object fills some of the space between the camera and that shadow.  How tall it
    is cannot be read from it: a low deep thing and a tall shallow one cast the same shadow.
*   For a height ``h`` there are two readings of one mask.  An upright ``prism``: the table cells
    that are in the shadow and whose column up to ``h`` stays in the mask; for a box or a can
    of that height these cells are its footprint, exactly.  Something that ``hangs`` from that
    height: every cell whose point at ``h`` is in the mask, with as much below it as the mask
    allows, standing on the table or not; that is a bowl from its rim down, or anything wider
    above than below.
*   A SECOND camera that sees the object from elsewhere settles the height: the solid a reading
    describes is projected into it and compared with the object's mask there.  The reading and
    height that match best are taken (:func:`measure`); the hanging one only where it matches
    clearly better, since whatever stands on its own footprint is a prism.  With only one mask
    the height is the tallest prism that still accounts for the whole mask, which is right for
    boxes and cans and a guess for a bowl.

:func:`measure` answers with the world point each pixel of the mask shows on that solid: what a
depth image would have given for an object of that shape.

A wrist camera always sees its own two fingers, and sometimes the other arm.  Those pixels
(:func:`robot_pixels`) are ``unknown`` in that view: what a reading puts behind them counts
neither for nor against it, and a mask that lies on them is the robot's, not the object's.
