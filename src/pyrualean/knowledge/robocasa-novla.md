# Operating knowledge for RoboCasa365: how the tools behave (no per-task procedures)

## Frames, units, robot
- A PandaOmron: one Franka arm with a two-finger gripper on an omnidirectional
  mobile base, in a kitchen with counters, cabinets, drawers, a stove, a sink,
  a fridge and a microwave.  World frame: x/y span the kitchen (coordinates
  of several metres), z up; metres and radians; quaternions are
  `[x, y, z, w]`.  Counters are at about z = 0.9 m; objects sit on counters,
  inside cabinets or in drawers.
- `state().eef_pos` is the gripper position, `state().base_pos` /
  `state().base_yaw` the base pose.  `back_project_batch` and
  `query_world_map` return points in the same world frame, directly
  comparable with `eef_pos`.
- The arm reaches about 0.8 m from the base.  If a target's x/y is farther
  than that from `base_pos`, the arm cannot get there: drive first
  (`navigate_to`), then manipulate.
- Every base motion - `navigate_to`, `move_base` - moves the arm and all
  three cameras with it.  Re-localise from a fresh world map afterwards (the
  arm servo recalibrates itself on its next call); never reuse pixels or
  world points taken before the base moved.
- Never hard-code world coordinates: layouts, fixtures and object placements
  change with the seed.  Localise everything from the latest world maps.
- The task instruction (`robo.task`) is authoritative.  Success is the
  environment's own predicate (`state().success`, `robo.done`);
  `state().task_progress` shows the live values that predicate computes and
  `success_criteria()` its source.

## Gripper
- `+1` (`robo.CLOSE`) drives the fingers shut and keeps squeezing; `-1`
  (`robo.OPEN`) opens; `"hold"` (`robo.HOLD`) servos the fingers to the width
  they had when the motion began.
- Carry with `"hold"`: it is the default of `move_to`, `move_delta`,
  `navigate_to` and `move_base`, so omit `gripper` while holding an object.
  A sustained `+1` squeezes a small object out of the fingers; carrying with
  `-1` silently drops it.
- `set_gripper(+1, steps)` closes actively (firms a grip), `release(steps)`
  opens to let go.  `rotate_pitch` and `set_gripper` take numeric commands
  only.
- `state().gripper_opening` (|q0| + |q1|) is about 0.04 at the start (fingers
  half open), about 0.08 fully open and about 0 when closed on nothing; a
  closed gripper whose opening stays clearly above 0 has something between
  the fingers.  The finger position alone is not proof of a hold: verify a
  grasp from the wrist image and the object moving with the gripper.

## Navigation
- `navigate_to(xy, tol)` turns the base to face the world target and drives
  forward with closed-loop steering (about 2.3 mm per env step: 300 steps
  cover roughly 0.7 m; give a long drive more `max_steps` or call it again)
  until it is within `tol`, then stops facing the target.  Choose `tol` = the
  standoff you want + the object's half depth: `tol=0.6` stops about 0.6 m
  in front of the target.  The first call spends a few steps calibrating the
  heading.
- There is no path planning.  `Navigation.stuck` (ran out of steps having
  moved < 0.12 m) means the base rammed a fixture: back off with
  `move_base(forward=-0.3, steps=10)`, then approach from a clearer
  direction.  Check the way ahead first: `floor_overlay()` paints walkable
  floor green and `query_world_map(0.0, 0.12, camera="navview")` lists floor
  clusters.
- `move_base(forward, lateral, turn, steps)` sends raw velocities in the
  robot's own frame (+forward ahead, +lateral to the right, +turn
  counter-clockwise, clipped to [-1, 1]).  For fine adjustments only: keep
  `forward <= 0.4`, `turn <= 0.3`, `steps <= 20` per call and re-observe
  between calls.

## Arm primitives
- `move_to(xyz, gripper="hold", step_clip=0.02, max_steps=200, tol=0.012)` is
  a closed-loop servo: `Move.reached` false means it stalled (out of reach,
  in contact, at a joint limit); do not repeat the same target - navigate
  closer or change the approach.  One call may travel at most 0.30 m (the
  library raises `ValueError`): split long traversals into 2-3 waypoints at
  carrying height.  `move_delta(dxyz)` is the same servo relative to the
  current position, for small approaches and lifts.
- Approach from above, descend vertically, retreat straight up before
  travelling; use `step_clip=0.012` for fine approaches and vertical
  retreats.
- `rotate_pitch(target_pitch, gripper=+1, n=12)` tilts the wrist by
  `target_pitch` radians (relative) over `n` steps, e.g. before threading the
  gripper into an opening whose front points along world +/-y; read
  `state().eef_tilt` before and after, since the primitive reports no angle.
- `scripted_grasp(xyz)` opens, hovers `approach_z` above the point, descends,
  closes and lifts: a coarse fallback for simple, well-localised objects.
  `Grasp.stage` names the stage that stalled.
- One action, then observe: the tool-calling agent checks the state after
  every command; in a program that is a loop inside one cell.  Do guarded
  approaches as a loop of small `move_delta` / `move_to` steps (5-10 mm in z
  near a surface, a rim or a handle) and after each one test the result and
  the state in code (`reached`, `final_eef_pos`, `gripper_opening`,
  `task_progress`, `robo.done`) and stop the loop on any of them; look at an
  image only when a contact or a scene change must be interpreted (the hold
  became uncertain, the object moved unexpectedly).

## Perception
- Three 256x256 cameras, all on the robot.  `agentview` (shoulder) is the
  semantic authority: what the objects and fixtures are and where they lie;
  its pixels back-project directly.  `wrist` (on the gripper) refines the
  geometry of the SAME candidate once the gripper is within about 20 cm; do
  not let it switch to a look-alike.  `navview` (forward-down, base mounted)
  shows the floor ahead: where the base can drive.
- Images are top-down (row 0 at the top) and pixel-aligned with the world
  maps of the same step and camera.  `back_project_batch(pixels)` returns
  each pixel's world point plus the median of the valid ones; sample 3-8
  pixels firmly on the object's top surface and use `median_xyz`; pixels on
  thin rims, edges, shadows or the gap to a counter hit the background.
  `query_world_map(z_min, z_max, ...)` finds clusters inside a height band
  (0.85-0.95 for objects on a counter) on the latest map; `world_map(camera)`
  is the whole array for your own reasoning.
- A visible surface point is not an object centre: take the median of
  several interior pixels; choose the grasp height from the object's surface
  and its size.  Flat things at counter height look alike in depth: identify
  the destination in the RGB image by the noun in the task.
- World maps of steps older than 25 are deleted; localise from the latest
  step, and re-localise after any base motion or contact.

## Observable gates (what "done with this phase" means)
- Only `state().success` (`robo.done`) proves task success; stop acting as
  soon as it fires.  Primitive success is not task success.
- `task_progress` is the intermediate feedback: read it at step 0 and after
  every action; a joint fraction, a counter or a sub-predicate flag moving in
  the requested direction shows the action worked, an unchanged one shows it
  did not.
- Grasp: `grasp_contact` / `held_apart` and the object moving with the
  gripper (compare the wrist image and world samples before and after a
  small lift).
- Transport: the hold stays stable through the lift, the drive and the
  waypoints.
- Placement: the object rests on the destination before `release`, then
  stays put while the arm retreats.  Rim or nearby placement is incomplete.
- Articulation (drawer, door, lid, dishwasher rack, mixer head): the part
  moves in the requested direction while contact is kept, and the joint
  value in `task_progress` crosses the threshold in `success_criteria()`.
- Appliance controls (stove, microwave, kettle, faucet): the corresponding
  flag in `task_progress` flips after one guarded contact; distinguish the
  control from printed markings.

## Recovery and budget
- After a failed phase name the first unmet gate and the blocker: wrong
  target, out of reach (drive closer), missed or lost grasp, stuck base (back
  off, new approach direction), premature release, unstable placement.
  Change one meaningful variable and verify; do not repeat the same
  primitive target twice.
- Near success, repair only the remaining blocker; do not restart the task
  or disturb what is already correct.
- Work in phases with in-code checks (`Move.reached`, `Navigation.reached`,
  `gripper_opening`, world samples before and after, `task_progress`,
  `robo.done`), and look at an image only when a decision depends on it.
- There is no reset: the episode is one shot.  Recover in place:
  re-observe, re-localise, drive or grasp again.
